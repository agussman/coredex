Core set of software classes and ontological relationships for representing common datatypes in a graph database

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic object model for representing data in a graph database. By including both an
ontologically valid model along with implenentation classes in software, it is hoped that these models will form a common framework
for tool and software development.
